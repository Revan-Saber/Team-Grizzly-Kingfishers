Details regarding our project and maybe who is doing what pieces:

Needs: [Name]
Devs: Ryan Brown, Joshua Calhoun, Andrew Phipps, Damien Remington


First Person Shooter

Player:
	Move
	shoot
	health
	Currently equipped ammo types (limit 2-3), any new ones picked up replace currently selected slot?
		- NOTE: we can start with only one selected that you can pickup and replace with other pickups, and if we have time
			we can start looking into doing 2-3 selectable ones.

Enemy:
	move
	shoot
	health
	element type (what type of ammo they use? can color them based off that too?)

Camera:
	self explanitory mostly, but ability to look around, likely will mimic that which we did in class for the most part, unless
		someone has any upgrade features in mind?

GameManager:
	Run UI elements? (gonna list these seperately below somewhere)
	manage enemies currently spawned in the game, how many have been killed, and any other ways we want to track enemies.
	Manage spawn/respawn of enemies.

UI Function Library:
	List of functions to call on the various buttons we implement in the game to send the correct information where it needs to go.

Ammo:
	Damage
	Speed?
	Type? (ie normal, fire, ice, poision, etc...)
	Time To Live (TTL)







Possible Nice to haves and Upgrades
	Ammo - adds a Damage over Time effect to who it hits,
	Resistances/Weaknesses - Different enemy types have damage resistance/weaknesses to types of ammo the player uses on them
	Collectibles as win conditions?
	Multiple game modes? IE Survive the waves for as long as possible to get a high score, or find and collect certain items in the map.
